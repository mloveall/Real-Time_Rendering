# WebGL Projects

Each folder in this repository consists of a project that I made by using WebGL.

#### Solar System:
A real-time rendering project that I made by using WebGL to simulate the Solar System, with a purpose of practicing my skills on rendering 3D objects and implementing basic camera controls.

#### Fractal Tree:
Another real-time rendering project that I made by using WebGL to randomly generate a fractal tree. Iâ€™m planning to add more interesting features, including scroll bars for branch settings and color variations, when I get some breaths from work.
