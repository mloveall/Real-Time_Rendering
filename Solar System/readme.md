# Solar System
Author: Mitchell Loveall

### Description:
A real-time rendering project that I made by using WebGL to simulate solar system, with a purpose of practicing skills on rendering 3D objects and implementing basic camera controls.

### Caution:
The only browsers that I have tested on are Google Chrome and Safari. Planets may not display correctly, or have potential bugs, on any other browsers.

### Instruction:
Unzip the file -> go to the "web" folder inside where you just unzipped everything to -> find a file named 'solar-system.html' -> open this file in Chrome or Safari -> magic happens.

### Controls:
Drag by using left mouse button to rotate the scene.
Drag by using right mouse button to move the camera.
Rotate middle mouse wheel to zoom in or out.
