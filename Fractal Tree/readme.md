# Fractal Tree
Author: Mitchell Loveall

#### Description:
A simple real-time rendering project that I made by using webGL to randomly generate a fractal tree. I'm planning to add more interesting features, including scroll bars for branch settings and color variations, when I get my other projects done.

#### Caution:
The only browsers that I have tested with are Google Chrome and Safari. The fractal tree may not display correctly or have potential bugs on any other browsers.

#### Instruction:
Unzip the downloaded file -> go to the unzipped folder -> find a file named 'fractaltree.html' under the 'web' folder -> open this file in Chrome/Safari -> click the 'Generate Fractal Tree' button to render the tree.
