| Description:
|
| A simple real-time rendering project that I made
| by using webGL to randomly generate a fractal
| tree. I'm planning to add more interesting
| features, including scroll bars for branch
| settings and color variations, when I get my other
| projects done.
--------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------
| Caution:
|
| The only browser that I had tested with is Google
| Chrome. The fractal tree may not display correctly
| or have potential bugs on the other browsers.
--------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------
| Instruction:
|
| Once you unzipped the file then go into the
| that folder, there should be a file named
| 'fractaltree.html' under the 'web' folder. Open
| this file in Chrome and render anything simply by
| clicking the 'Generate Fractal Tree' button.
